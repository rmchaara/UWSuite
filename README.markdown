Introduction
------------
UW Suite is the beginning of an iOS application that takes advantage of the open data available on api.uwaterloo.ca and presents it to University of Waterloo students who wish to access this data in a more presentable manner. The idea was initially hacked out at a hackathon and despite the definite work that is still needed, it spawned into what it is now.

Initially I wanted to just release something to the Appstore with the current state that it is in now, however I have decided to hold off from that until this application has a presentable user experience.

If any of you would like to contribute to this project, just submit a pull and I will be more than happy to look over it as soon as possible. I would also like to open the invite to people who would like to use my code and shape it towards creating their own project however I ask that you please reference my work. I realize that this is the internet so I'm taking a gamble here but be nice :)

Current State
------------
As of right now, the application created has 4 main views that are available to the user including a main screen.

This screen is pretty self explanatory and will link directly to the features of the application upon clicking the icons.
